## My process

### Built with

- Plain ol' HTML & CSS

### What I learned

I wanted to try to create the component using only the most vanilla of web development tools, and I think it turned out alright!

I would have loved to balance the text better using `text-wrap`, but it seems it is not yet supported in most browsers.

### Continued development

While I specifically did not want to use FlexBox for this, I might begin using it for ease of use in future projects. Furthermore, I believe it is important to become familiar and confident with especially CSS, before exploring more advanced frameworks such as ReactJs.
